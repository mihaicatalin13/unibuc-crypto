- 🔑 Uni project for crypto subject

- 📝 I got to solve a problem from the International Olympiad in Cryptography (exercise 1)

* 💥 Technique used was brute forcing through file sizes

* 🐱‍💻 For the second exercise I got to encrypt the letters in my name using aes-128-ecb algorithm. Then once I got to match them with their corresponding headers, it was easy to prove that this block cipher leaks patterns in the encrypted images
